## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build an Apache Cassandra NoSQL analytics database for a hypothetical music streaming service called Sparkify. The analytics team at Sparkify wants to know what, when, and how users are listening to songs on the service's music app. The songplay data, which is now kept in raw csv files on a local directory, needs to be easy to query and analyse.

## Project structure

1. **event_data** folder nested at the home of the project, where all needed data reside.
2. **Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb** the code itself.
3. **event_datafile_new.csv** a smaller event data csv file that will be used to insert data into the Apache Cassandra tables.
4. **images** a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the event_datafile_new.csv. 
5. **README.md** current file, provides discussion on my project.

## How to Use

Launch **Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb** to run validation and example queries.
